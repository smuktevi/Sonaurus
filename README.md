This is a Music Database in which users have their individual profiles and have access to the database of songs, artists, albums and playlists. The database contains a huge collection of songs of varying genres and artists. 

The project aims to make the experience of a music enthusiast better. The user can search and enjoy any song he wants based on its name, artist, genre, etc. The user can acquire all the details they want about different artists and albums.
The user also obtains playlists based on his favourite genre. Thus, there’s a personalised experience as each user gets a playlist of his choice. A list of songs he can enjoy and doesn’t have to bother searching for each song, each time.
